The pair from the central town of Kadoma live under the same roof but have been assigned to different polling stations in one of a series of anomalies in the voters' roll that have raised fears of rigging. \"I'll go my way, she'll go her way -- it's the new abnormal,\" Tendai, who supports the opposition and preferred to use a pseudonym over safety concerns, told AFP via phone. The southern African country votes to elect the president and legislature on August 23 in what analysts expect to be a tense affair, amid a crackdown on dissent and a disaffected population battling hyperinflation, poverty and high unemployment. Suspicions over possible election irregularities are rife in a nation that has been ruled by the same party since independence in 1980 and has a long history of disputed votes. Activists at Team Pachedu, a civil society group, say an analysis of the roll suggests such fears are well grounded. \"We have discovered a lot of irregularities,\" said Tafadzwa Sambiri, a spokesman for the group. \"Chief among them is the recycling of IDs\". The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) did not reply to a request for comment. IDs in Zimbabwe come with an identification number that is meant to stick with a person for life -- but that doesn't appear to be the case for some. Team Pachedu said it found thousands of ID numbers that were linked to a person in the 2013 elections but are tied to a different name in 2023. In some cases, the name stayed the same but the date of birth has changed -- something sceptics might think suggests these people do not actually exist. The group said it found other oddities, like people who are dead or registered twice or seemingly crammed in a relatively small space -- such as the 183 voters living in the same house on the outskirts of Harare. Thousands of others, like Tendai, have noticed their place of voting has changed. \"I now have to board a taxi to Southerton which is about three kilometres from where I stay. It's costly and not convenient for me,\" said a woman from Harare, who also preferred to remain anonymous. The issue first came to light in May, when election authorities made the roll available for inspections, and many found their names had been removed or misplaced. Among them was David Coltart, a former education minister and a member of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), the leading opposition party, who after a day of searching figured he had been moved to a polling station further away from the house he has inhabited for decades. \"(This) is hugely problematic, particularly in rural areas where people don't have access to the internet and don't have decent means of transport,\" Coltart said. On election day some might suddenly find they have gone to the wrong place, he explained. In some instances, voters from ruling party strongholds appear to have been moved in bulk to opposition leaning areas, according to Team Pachedu. Activists fear the anomalies could prove decisive. The vote is largely expected to be a rematch between President Emmerson Mnangagwa, 80, of the ruling ZANU-PF party, and CCC leader Nelson Chamisa, a 45-year-old lawyer and pastor. Mnangagwa won the last elections in 2018 with a narrow margin, bringing home 50.8 percent of the vote. The results were disputed but Chamisa lost the legal battle in court. A report by Human Rights Watch last week said the upcoming ballot will be held under a \"seriously flawed electoral process\" that does not meet global standards for freedom and fairness. It pointed at ZEC's \"lack of impartiality\" as one of the many issues, along with the adoption of repressive laws to muffle dissent and the use of intimidation, violence and the courts against the opposition. Yet Coltart said the CCC remained confident it has strong enough support to overcome such obstacles and carry the day. \"There's no doubt that ZANU-PF and Mnangagwa pulled out all the stops to do everything possible to prevent Chamisa and the 'Triple C' from winning,\" he told AFP. \"But the question still remains whether it's going to be sufficient\". International observers, including missions from the European Union and the African Union, have been invited to monitor the vote. Mnangagwa has vowed that the elections will be free and fair.

        "content": "Uvalde school shooter's cousin, 17, arrested after 'threatening to do the same thing' at a Texas school Nathan Cruz, 17, was reported to authorities by his own mother - who said he was planning to 'do the same thing' as his cousin, Salvador Ramos Teen suspect Cruz, from San Antonio, made the concerning statements to his sister and was also overheard trying to buy an AR-15 illegally By Claudia Aoraha, Senior Reporter For Dailymail.Com Updated: 05:11, 8 August 2023 e-mail 120 shares 2 View comments A teenage boy, who is the cousin of the Uvalde school shooter, has been arrested in Texas for allegedly threatening to shoot up a local elementary school. Nathan Cruz, 17, from San Antonio, was reported to authorities by his own mother - who said he was planning to 'do the same thing' as his cousin, Salvador Ramos. Ramos was the gunman who opened fire and killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary in 2022 - before using their innocent blood to etch heinous messages on whiteboards in the classrooms. He was eventually neutralized by police after a litany of delays getting to him. Teen suspect Cruz made the concerning statements to his sister and was also overheard trying to buy an AR-15 illegally, the arrest warrant seen by KSAT states. Nathan Cruz, 17, from San Antonio, was reported to authorities by his own mother - who said he was planning to 'do the same thing' as his cousin, Salvador Ramos. Ramos was the gunman who opened fire and killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary in 2022 (pictured) Salvador Ramos - who killed multiple children and teachers in Uvalde in 2022 The family live across the street from an elementary school, documents revealed. According to the mom, the 17-year-old was intoxicated when he made the threats to shoot up the school like his cousin Ramos. Cruz had also recently made the comment: 'School is starting soon.' When in the car with his sister, Cruz also allegedly threatened to shoot her in the head and stated that he would 'shoot the school.' The family deemed the threats to be credible because of their familial connection to Uvalde shooter Ramos. In this aerial view, law enforcement works on scene at Robb Elementary School Law enforcement officers are told to stay back as officer Ramos - whose daughter was one of the 19 children who were killed - is seen physically held back by fellow enforcement officers According to the warrant, one of Cruz's family members told police she overheard a phone conversation between Cruz and an unidentified person where he 'attempted to acquire an AR-15 through an illegal private sale.' He is also currently on probation, but it is unclear what for. Nathan Cruz was booked into Bexar County Jail on Monday on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to the public. He is also charged with making a terroristic threat to a family member. So far, no bond amount has been set. The 19 children and two teachers butchered in Texas elementary school shooting Amerie Jo Garza, 10 Amerie Jo Garza (right) Amerie Jo Garza, a fourth grader at Robb Elementary, was one of 19 students confirmed to be killed Tuesday morning by Ramos, who cops say was carrying a handgun and an AR-15 during the attack that also killed two teachers in the classroom. Her grandmother, Berlinda Irene Arreola, said the 10-year-old was killed as she tried to phone 911 while sitting next to her best friend, who ended up 'covered in her blood.' Arreola said Ramos told the students and staffers inside the room, 'You're going to die,' before opening fire - shooting her granddaughter dead as she tried to phone for help. 'So the gunman went in and he told the children, 'You're going to die,' Berlinda told The Daily Beast. 'And [Amerie] had her phone and she called 911. And instead of grabbing it and breaking it or taking it from her, he shot her. She was sitting right next to her best friend. Her best friend was covered in her blood.' Uziyah Garcia Uziyah Garcia, 8 Uziyah Garcia, the youngest victim at age eight, was also killed in the attack. The child's family announced he was killed hours after announcing he was among the many children unaccounted for following the tragedy. The boy's grandfather, Manny Renfro, broke the news early Wednesday after being notified by authorities. '[He was] the sweetest little boy that I've ever known,' Renfro said. 'I'm not just saying that because he was my grandkid.' Renfro recalled how Uziyah last visited him in San Angelo over spring break. 'We started throwing the football together and I was teaching him pass patterns. 'Such a fast little boy and he could catch a ball so good,' the grieving grandad said. 'There were certain plays that I would call that he would remember and he would do it exactly like we practiced.' Makenna Elrod, 10 Makenna Lee Elrod Makenna Elrod, 10, had also been among the missing in the chaos that followed the massacre, with her father, Brandon Elrod telling reporters at the time he feared 'she may not be alive.' Her death was eventually confirmed by a family friend on Wednesday. 'It's pretty sad what this world's coming to,' the girl's father told local outlet KTRK after the shooting. A mother of one of Makenna's friends lamented the loss in a post to Facebook. 'Sweet Makenna Rest in Paradise!! My heart is shattered as my daughter Chloe loved her so much!!' the mom wrote. A relative Wednesday confirmed that the girl had been among the victims. Xavier Lopez, 10 Xavier Lopez Xavier Lopez, 10, was the first student victim to be identified as one of Ramos' victims. The child's mother, Felicha Martinez, told the Washington Post Tuesday that just hours before the massacre, the mom had been at the school to see her son participate an honor roll ceremony. She took a picture showing her son showing off his certificate. In the last exchange she had with the child, the mom heartbreakingly told the boy that she was proud of him and that she loved him, giving him a hug goodbye - not knowing it would be the last time she would see him alive. 'He was funny, never serious and his smile… that smile I will never forget,' she recalled after learning of his death from police. 'It would always cheer anyone up.' The boy's cousin, Lisa Garza, 54, of Arlington, said Xavier enjoyed swimming and had been looking forward to the summer. 'He was just a loving 10-year-old little boy, just enjoying life, not knowing that this tragedy was going to happen today,' she said. 'He was very bubbly, loved to dance with his brothers, his mom. This has just taken a toll on all of us.' Amelia Sandoval, Lopez's grandmother, said: 'It's just so hard... you send your kids to school thinking they are going to make it back home but they're not.' Eliahana Torres, 10 Eliahana Cruz Torres Eliahana Cruz Torres, 10, had also been missing for hours until she was confirmed to be among the dead. Adolfo Cruz, her great-grandfather, said she didn't want to attend school the day of the shooting - but was told by her family that she had to attend. He said he remained outside the school gates throughout the night until he leanrned of her fate from local authorities. 'I hope she is alive,' he said at the time. Torres was an avid baseball player and played the sport in a local little league. Ellie Lugo, 10 Ellie Lugo Ellie Lugo was named as a victim of Tuesday's attack by her parents, with Steven Garcia and Jennifer Lugo confirming her death several hours after she was listed among the missing. 'It's hard to issue out a statement on anything right now my mind is going at 1000 miles per hour… but I do wanna send our thoughts and prayers to those who also didn't make it home tonight!!! Our Ellie was a doll and was the happiest ever,' Steven Lugo said Wednesday. 'Mom and Dad love you never forget that and please try and stay by our side.' Nevaeh Bravo, 10 Nevaeh Bravo Nevaeh Bravo was confirmed to be among the dead late Tuesday, after her cousin posted on social media following the shooting to ask for helping the girl. Around 9 pm, she broke the news on Twitter. 'Unfortunately my beautiful Nevaeh was one of the many victims from todays tragedy,' she wrote. Sje said the schoolchild was 'flying high' and asked for the family to be kept in people's prayers 'Our Nevaeh has been found. She is flying with the angels above. We love you Navaeh very much princess.' 'Thank you for the support and help,' she wrote. 'Rest in peace my sweet girl, you didn't deserve this.' Bravo's age could not immediately be confirmed. Tess Marie Mata Tess Marie Mata Tess Marie Mata was also among those to perish in the attack, her sister, Faith Mata, revealed in a post to Facebook Wednesday. 'I honestly have no words just sadness, confusion, and anger,' she wrote. 'I'm sad because we will never get to tag team on mom and dad again and tell each other how much we mean to each other, I'm confused because how can something like this happen to my sweet, caring, and beautiful sister, and I'm angry because a coward took you from us.' Photos shared with the post showed Tess smiling in a baby photo, snuggling with a cat, doing gymnastics, flashing a peace sign, and posing in front of a large heart mural. 'Sissy I miss you so much, I just want to hold you and tell you how pretty you are, I want to take you outside and practice softball, I want to go on one last family vacation, I want to hear your contagious laugh, and I want you to hear me tell you how much I love you,' she wrote. Her age could not immediately be confirmed. Rojelio Torres, 10 Rojelio Torres Rojelio Torres, 10, was initially reported missing by his father, but on Wednesday was confirmed dead by his family. A person who said she was the boy's cousin wrote on Twitter: 'It breaks my heart to say my rojelio is now with the angels I'll forever miss you and love you my angel.' The child's father , Federico Torres, told Houston reporters that he was at work when he learned about the shooting and immediately raced to the school. 'They sent us to the hospital, to the civic center, to the hospital and here again, nothing, not even in San Antonio,' he said. 'They don't tell us anything, only a photo, wait, hope that everything is well.' Nearly half a day later, cops broke the news to the boy's family. 'Our entire family waited almost 12 hours since the shooting to find out Rojelio Torres, my 10-year-old nephew, was killed in this tragedy,' Torres' aunt, Precious Perez, told KSAT. 'We are devastated and heartbroken. Rojer was a very intelligent, hard-working and helpful person. He will be missed and never forgotten.' Jayce Carmelo Luevanos, 10 Jayce Luevanos Jayce Luevanos, 10, died in the shooting along with his ten-year-old cousin, Jailah, the child's mother said Wednesday.

I'm just lost right now!!! Fly high my beautiful Angels!!' Jailah Nicole Silguero, 10 Jailah Nicole Silguero Ten-year-old Jailah Nicole Silguero was also killed in the shooting, her mother, Veronica Luevanos, tearfully revealed to Univision Wednesday. She also lost her 10-year-old nephew Jayce to the tragedy. She said Jailah loved to dance and film videos on TikTok. The child reportedly also asked her mom the morning of the shooting if she could stay home from school - a request the now mourning mom rebuffed. 'I took her to school, but she didn't want to go. She told her father, 'Can I stay home?'' Luevanos said, noting that it was not a common occurrence for her daughter to make such a request. 'I think she knew something would happen.' Luevanos' mom confirmed the loss on Facebook Wednesday. 'Fly high my angels. We're going to miss yall so much,' wrote Veronica Luevanos - whose dad had died just a week earlier. 'I'm so heart broken,' she wrote with a photo of her daughter and nephew. 'My baby I love u so much … fly high baby girl.' Alithia Ramirez, 10 Alithia Ramirez Fourth grader Alithia Ramirez was confirmed dead early Wednesday by her father, Ryan Ramirez, who shared a post to Facebook showing the 10-year-old with angel's wings.

'Trying to find my daughter Alithia. I called all the hospitals and nothing,' he wrote at the time. He also reporters during his frantic search, 'I'm trying to find out where my baby's at.' Annabell Guadalupe Rodriguez, 10 Annabell Guadalupe Rodriguez Annabell Guadalupe Rodriguez, 10, was another killed by Ramos Tuesday - along with her cousin, who has yet to be identified. Annabell's father spent the afternoon after the shooting in frantic search for his daughter. Speaking to KHOU11 Tuesday, he lamented at how he was at a loss as to what do, having little success with the search. 'They're not letting us in at the hospital right now so we don't know where to go.' She has since been declared to be among the dead.

Miller's kids had also been at the school at the time of the shooting, but survived the attack.

Alexandria 'Lexi' Aniyah Rubio, 10 Alexandria Aniyah Rubio Alexandria Aniyah Rubio - who was better known to friends as 'Lexi' - was confirmed dead just before midnight on Tuesday.

For this the performance appraisal system to advance the age of superannuation has been recommended by the committee. If all goes well, the retirement age of the employees may see an increase of 3 years. Recommends Appraisal System for Advancement of Retirement Age In fact, the evaluation system for extending the tenure of Supreme Court and High Court judges beyond the existing retirement age has been recommended by a parliamentary committee. The recommendation made on Monday recommended an increase in the retirement age of high court judges, including judges of the Supreme Court. At present, judges of the Supreme Court retire at the age of 65, while judges of the High Court leave office at the age of 62. The Standing Committee on Law and Personnel submitted its report on judicial procedure and their reforms. In which it was said that the work of SC and High Court judges in public institutions can be re-evaluated to ensure their impartiality. Possible increase in the retirement age of judges The committee in its 133rd report on the subject of judicial process and their reforms said that it felt that the retirement age of judges should be increased. Para 47 of the report recommended that the relevant article of the Constitution of India needs to be amended and the retirement age of Supreme Court and High Court judges should be increased suitably. Halo’s recommendation clarified that while increasing the retirement age, the quality of judgments and decisions taken, including the performance and health status of judges, should be taken into account. Re-evaluation should be done on the basis of number of judgments whereas 48 mentioned. In which it was said that a system of evaluation by the Supreme Court Collegium may be devised and implemented before recommending any judge for extension of his tenure. Number of pending cases more than 60 lakh The pendency of cases in respect of the High Court is more than 60 lakhs as on date. This is a serious problem but all the High Courts have very high level of vacancies. The report said that as on December 31 last year, the total vacancy of the High Court was 30% of the sanctioned strength and many of them had 40 to 50% vacancies. In such a situation, an increase in the retirement age has been recommended.

        "content": "Inside Sandra Bullock's heartbreaking love life from Jesse James' infidelity to the tragic death of her partner Bryan Randall following a secret ALS battle Over the weekend, the 59-year-old Oscar winner experienced the devastating loss of her longtime partner, Bryan Randall, following a private battle with ALS The couple first met back in 2015, after he photographed her son Louis' birthday, five years after her messy divorce from Jesse James She previously dated Ryan Gosling, Matthew McConaughey, Tate Donovan, Chris Evans and more stars By Deirdre Durkan-simonds For Dailymail.com Updated: 21:42 EDT, 7 August 2023 e-mail View comments While Sandra Bullock is famous for portraying a range of romantic leading-lady roles, she has undoubtedly weathered some brutal storms in her love life off-screen. Over the weekend, the 59-year-old Oscar winner experienced the devastating loss of her longtime partner, Bryan Randall, following a private battle with ALS. He was 57. The couple first met back in 2015, after he photographed her son Louis' birthday, five years after her messy divorce from Jesse James, who admitted to having several affairs during their marriage. Despite her past heartbreaks, the mother-of-two previously raved that she was 'so glad the universe had [her] wait' to raise her family with the right person. 'I found the love of my life,' Bullock said of Randall in 2021. 'We share two beautiful children — three children, his older daughter. It's the best thing ever.' Upon reflecting on her relationship with the photographer, the actress confessed that she wasn't too concerned about getting married and was all about putting their 'children first.' 'I don't need a paper to be a devoted partner, devoted mother,' she said while appearing on the Red Table Talk . 'I don't need to be told to be ever-present in the hardest of times.' As the world grieves Randall's death, DailyMail.com revisited Bullock's whirlwind relationship with him and her entire dating history, including past romances with Ryan Gosling and Matthew McConaughey. Tragic: While Sandra Bullock is famous for portraying a range of romantic leading-lady roles, she has undoubtedly weathered some brutal storms in her love life off-screen, including the recent death of her partner Bryan Randall (seen above in 2018) Bryan Randall (2015-2023) Sandra and Bryan began dating several months after first meeting, and even attended Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's wedding that same year. The couple do not have any children together, but Bullock has two adopted children — son Louis, 13, and daughter Laila, 11 — and Bryan has an adult daughter named Skylar from a previous relationship. The actress was in the process of adopting her second child when things got serious with Bryan. Sandra met Bryan when she hired him as a photographer to take pictures at her son's fifth birthday, and described him as a 'saint' after she informed him she was adopting a second child when they 'hadn't been together that long.' 'I said, 'Remember that NDA you signed when you photographed my son?' I said, 'You know, that still holds.' He said 'Why?' I said, 'I'm bringing a child home when I come back from Toronto,'' Sandra told Jada Pinkett Smith on her Facebook Watch series. 'He was so happy, but he was scared. I'm a bulldozer. My life was already on the track and here's this beautiful human being who doesn't want anything to do with my life, but the right human being to be there.' She also described her partner as being 'very Christian' and a great example to the children. 'I don't always agree with him and he doesn't always agree with me,' she said, adding: 'But if they can take away from that and that is where they feel drawn to, he's the exact right parent to be in this position.' On Monday, Randall's family confirmed his death to People . 'It is with great sadness that we share that on Aug. 5, Bryan Randall passed away peacefully after a three-year battle with ALS,' the photographer's family said in a statement. 'Bryan chose early to keep his journey with ALS private and those of us who cared for him did our best to honor his request.' 'We are immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours,' the family statement continued. 'At this time we ask for privacy to grieve and to come to terms with the impossibility of saying goodbye to Bryan.' Love of her life: Sandra and Bryan began dating several months after first meeting, and even attended Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's wedding that same year; seen in 2018 Chris Evans (2014) Back in 2014, rumors surfaced that the Marvel star was heavily 'pursuing Sandra.' At the time, a source told Us Weekly that the pair attended a dinner party with friends at Craig's, and 'spent the night talking until 12 a.m.' The insider noted that the hunk, who is 17 years younger than the Ocean's 8 star, is 'totally her type.' When asked about the reports, Bullock mused that the media was 'a little behind.' 'We've since married and it started breaking apart, so we separated,' she joked to Entertainment Weekly . 'We filed for divorce, and I hope everyone can respect our privacy. But we're going to remain friends and share responsibility of the farm animals we've taken on, because you just can't abandon the animals.' During their brief romance, they were photographed out dining a handful of times. But back in 2012, Chris revealed to Details that he had a poster of Bullock on his bedroom wall. 'She's been his dream girl for most of his life, so it would be a fairy-tale ending for Chris,' a source told OK! Magazine in 2014. Brief romance: Back in 2014, rumors surfaced that Chris Evans was heavily 'pursuing Sandra' (Evans seen in 2023) Jesse James (2003-2010) Bullock and the Monster Garage host, 54, met after she brought her motorcycle-obsessed godson on a trip to West Coast Choppers's Long Beach headquarters in 2003. After James gave her a private tour, the star came home to a call to the father-of-four, who she rejected twice. Eventually, he managed to woo her with a virtual game of 20 Questions. After assuming he would just ask her questions about cars and motorcycles, they began a 'courtship of letters.' 'It was not something I wanted, needed, or looked for, but because he was a stronger person than I was, spiritually and on a tolerance level, I was lucky enough that he educated me,' she told Vanity Fair in 2006. Upon speaking about his preconceived notions about Bullock, James told Nightline in a 2010 that he feared that she would be 'b**ch and some Hollywood snob and didn't really give it two thoughts.' 'I talked to her for a couple minutes and it was like getting hit in the head with a brick. Here's a woman I had assumptions about and she couldn't be farther from that,' James said. The pair ultimately wed in 2005, in front of 270 of their closest friends and family at a ranch in the San Ynez Valley. In March 2010, days after she took home an Academy Award for her performance in The Blind Side, several women came forward about their affairs with Jesse. A month later, Jesse checked himself into a rehab facility in Arizona for sex addiction after apologizing profusely to Bullock, although that wasn't enough to save the marriage – they divorced the following June. In 2017, he told DailyMail.com: 'Yeah, I did cheat on my wife, yeah... I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And that's [the] end of story.' Messy: Bullock and the Monster Garage host, 54, met after bringing her motorcycle-obsessed godson a trip to West Coast Choppers's Long Beach headquarters for Christmas in 2003 (pictured in 2010) Ryan Gosling (2002-2003) The two stars met while filming the psychological thriller, Murder by Numbers, in 2001. Despite their 16-year age gap, their professional relationship eventually turned romantic. When asked by Cosmopolitan if they were 'just friends,' she admitted: 'If you were to add the word 'just,' it would probably be a bit of a lie. So, I'd say we're friends.' While speaking about Gosling, the star revealed he taught her how 'to chill' and 'disregard all that isn't important.' 'He's like a little Buddha,' she said. Their nearly two-year romance came to an end in 2003, but the duo remained amicable. In 2011, he blamed 'show business' for their split. 'When both people are in show business, it's too much show business. It takes all of the light, so nothing else can grow,' he told The Independent. He also called her and other ex-girlfriend Rachel McAdams 'the greatest girlfriends of all time.' 'I haven't met anybody who could top them,' he admitted, months before meeting his wife, Eva Mendes. Costars-turned-lovers: Bullock and Gosling met while filming the psychological thriller, Murder by Numbers, in 2001 Bob Schneider (1991-2001) Bullock dated the Texas–based musician from 1999 to 2001. 'As celebrities go, Bob and I have a very low-key relationship,' she told Cinema.com in 2000. 'It's something I learned through trial and error.' She admitted: 'Dating is complicated for me. I have a fear of saying the l-word. Oh my God! I always feel like the minute I say it the sky will fall.' 'Bob and I talk German all the time to each other, which is terribly funny because I'm so bad at it. Maybe saying 'I love you' in German could be easier for me,' she continued. His track Blue Skies for Everyone is in her 2000 film Gun Shy and his song, Bullets, is featured on her 2000 action comedy Miss Congeniality soundtrack. Bullock and Bob Schneider dated from 1999 to 2001 (seen in 2000) Matthew McConaughey (1996- 1998) The Virginia native fell head over heels for Matthew McConaughey after meeting him on the set of the 1996 film A Time To Kill. The former couple managed to quietly date in secret for two years, until parting ways in 1998. In 2003 when reflecting on remaining good friends over the years, Bullock said: 'It's the work we both put in. There's a great amount of respect and love. I feel very cared for by Matthew. No matter where he is in his life or where I am in mine—he could be married—I know we would stay close.' While presenting her with the Decade of Hotness award at the 2014 Guys Choice awards, he quipped: 'I've worked with you. I've tried to kiss you, successfully and unsuccessfully. I've been directed by you, in a short film and also to the exit of many bars.' Additionally, he has vocalized his desire to work together on another film. '[Sandra] and I have another version of our relationship to put on film, and we're looking for something. She's not a little girl. She's a woman. She could run a country,' he previously told Playboy. Love on set: The Virginia native fell head over heels for Matthew McConaughey after meeting him on the set of the 1996 film A Time To Kill; seen in 1999 Don Padilla (1996) The Golden Globe winner and film technician Don Padilla dated for 10 months. During their short-lived romance, the pair attended the July 1995 premiere of The Net together. She stated that her then-unidentified boyfriend was a 'really sweet person.' Due to his work schedule, she admitted that 'it's been rough' since he works 'all the time' and she 'rarely' gets to 'see him.' 'For a year, I was by myself trying to date and I'm telling you dating was the worst experience I ever had,' she told Detour, at the time. 'I seem to have attracted everyone whose intentions were not the best.' A year later, she reflected on navigating their breakup and her work to Rolling Stone. 'I had to look at myself and go, 'I'm responsible for so many things now, what am I choosing to hold close to my heart? And what do I choose to let go of and not control?' Bullock told the magazine. 'You learn what you're made of.' Less than a year of dating: The Golden Globe winner and film technician Don Padilla dated for 10 months (pictured in 1995) Troy Aikman (1995) The All About Steve star and former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman are rumored to have dated briefly in 1995. While their romance fizzled after just a few dates, the duo reconnected after their respective divorces through a mutual friend during Christmas break in 2013. He was married to former Cowboys publicist Rhonda Worthey from 2000 to 2011. He went on to remarry Catherine 'Capa' Mooty in 2017. In July 2023, news broke that he and Mooty had officially divorced. Nothing serious: The All About Steve star and former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman are rumored to have dated briefly in 1995; seen in 2022 Tate Donovan (1990-1995) America's sweetheart and the O.C. alum dated for nearly four years, and were even engaged. After calling off their engagement in 1995, he told Vanity Fair: 'I can’t explain why things worked out the way they did. We both know why it happened.' While their romance didn't work out, it led to her friendship with Jennifer Aniston. 'We were introduced by our former boyfriend. I say ‘our’ because you and I both partook of this one human being,' she said during an Interview cover story. 'We both partook of Tate. … Who was a very patient human being, given that he dated us both.' Young love: America's sweetheart and the O.C. alum dated for nearly four years, and were even engaged; seen in 1993 While reflecting on her love life, Bullock told news.com.au that she has 'never felt like a victim' and always takes 'the high road.' 'The papers said I was ‘unlucky in love.’ And yes, I’ve had a couple of missteps but I also did some things I’m not very proud of to people who were wonderful,' she admitted. Over the years, however, she has learned, 'revenge, anger, resentment only hurts you and it doesn’t make sense because you’re the one falling apart while they don’t even care.' 'So once you learn forgiveness and to let it go, inevitably you’re shown why that happened and something better steps in every single time,' she said. Additionally, she said that 'marriage isn't the ultimate ending.'

Addressing an award ceremony in Islamabad on Monday, the prime minister assured Chinese companies and investors that the “difficult time for them is now over”. Shehbaz said he was aware that the Chinese companies faced a tough time and problems in the recent past during the tenure of the previous government, Geo News reported. He assured Chinese investors to further simplify procedures for the companies working in Pakistan, especially under the umbrella of CPEC and implement them in letter and spirit. Earlier, the prime minister gave awards to top-performing Chinese companies working especially on projects under CPEC in Pakistan. The premier said that the government had launched a great initiative “The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC)”, which would consist of all main stakeholders including the federal government, all provincial governments and institutions particularly the Pakistan Army led by General Syed Asim Munir. The prime minister said the army chief had personally contributed to this programme in a way that it had no parallel in the past as he was totally dedicated to promote the cause of Pakistan and the people who had education and talent but no jobs. “The programme, SIFC will dovetail with the entire CPEC mechanism and will be a propeller in terms of Pakistan’s industrial agri progress,” he added.
